## Extension: booking system ##
Inclusion of an Appointment model to record requested face-to-face call slots with the site owner. 
Booking form added, linked on the about page, which allows users to book a half-hour slot. Users are redirected to their display of a list of appointments (which shows only appointments booked by them, or all appointments if a site admin is logged in). 

### Further Features ###
- The bookings display is rudimentary, and needs styling
- The booking system itself needs additional functionality to prevent double-booking.

Setting the form up to create an entry within the Appointment model was informed by [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46550787/trying-to-create-a-django-model-instance-via-a-form-but-i-only-want-to-extract)
